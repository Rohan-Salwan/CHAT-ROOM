# CHAT-ROOM
CHAT-ROOM is a messaging application and it has two main modes first one is Public-Chat and 
second one is Private-Chat so user can go with the specific choice. Moreover, User can switch 
mode at any time by using some specific commands so features are very easy accessible. 
In addition, on Server-Side there are some privileges like first one is kick so server side 
person can kick anyone at anytime and second one is blocking so server side mantainer can 
block anyone. Right now it can only operate by command line but GUI is also coming soon.
